# Abstractive Text Summarization Tools using Transformers

## Using GPT-3.5, BART, and T-5 Transformers

We created a summarization tool using three different transformers to evaluate how well each one of these transformers does. We find that there's a trade-off in using each of these transformers when we fine-tuned or prompt engineer them.

## Web Scraper

Along with the summarization, we also incorporated the aspect of using a web scraper to get extract text from web sites and then summarizing this texts (we tried for news articles in specific).
